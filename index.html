											<h2>Introduction</h2>

										<p>We are an entirely student run volunteer organization. Our program seeks 
                                        to inspire students to pursue STEM through engaging presentations and hands-on
                                        activities and labs. We volunteer at Carolyn Clark Elementary School every 
                                        other Wednesday.

									<h2>About Us</h2>
								</header>
                                <p>IST was founded in September 2015 by three current juniors at EVHS with the aim of inspiring students to expore science, technology, engineering, and math related fields. We have a deep passion for STEM, and wanted to give back to our community through this program.</p>

									<h2>Our Program</h2>
									<p>Integrated Science and Technology aims to inspire students to pursue STEM in a unique, hands-on approach. Each session consists of three hands on components: an engaging demonstration to interest students, a presentation about a relevant STEM topic, and a lab experiment to allow students to apply the knowledge they have learned. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Some of our previous labs include physical and chemical changes with lava lamps, chemical reactions with gel and salt, and biological compounds with a fruit DNA extraction lab.</p>
